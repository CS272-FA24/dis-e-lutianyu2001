1.  Put all the books in a pile, we call this pile the "original" pile.
2.  Pick up the first book from the "original" pile.
3.  Place this book on the floor or a separate surface, starting a new "sorted" pile.
4.  If the "original" pile still have book, pick up the next book from the "original" pile.
5.  Compare the title of this book to the title of the book(s) in the "sorted" pile.
6.  If the title of the new book comes before the first book in the "sorted" pile alphabetically, place it at the beginning of the "sorted" pile.
7.  If the title of the new book comes after the last book in the "sorted" pile alphabetically, place it at the end of the "sorted" pile.
8.  If the title of the new book falls between two books in the "sorted" pile alphabetically, insert it between those two books.
9.  GOTO step 4 if the "original" pile still has book.
10. The books are now sorted in alphabetical order in the "sorted" pile.
